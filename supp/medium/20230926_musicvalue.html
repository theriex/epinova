<h1>Keeping the value of your music.</h1>

<p>Your music is worth is what it's worth to you.  That's independent
whether it exists on collectible vinyl, as a file on your phone, or
streaming somewhere in the cloud.  It's independent of the cost of
purchasing the song.  The value of your music is your perception of it, and
it's up to you to hold that value for yourself.  Here's the strategy I've
used for decades to keep the value of my music, perhaps it will help
you:  Listen.  Attend. Keep. </p>

<h2>Listen</h2>

<p>How much you listen, how you listen, what you listen to, and the meaning
you attribute to what you listen to, will all evolve over time, and ebb and
flow within time in periods ranging from days to years.  Listening is deeply
personal, part of your identity, and what connects you to others who
appreciate the same music you enjoy. </p>

<p>Listening is the foundation of music value. </p>

<p>Your music will always have nostalgic value related to your memory, and
personal value in how it relates to your identity in time.  If you own a
music collection, it might have some monetary or decorative value, but the
main value to you is in listening to it.  Music lasts over time, and its
listening value evolves over time as its context and your own context
change.  Listening to a song is a little bit different each time, and its
value is reaffirmed each time you hear it. </p>

<h2>Attend</h2>

<p>Attention is noticing value.  You might notice while you are otherwise
occupied.  Working, reading, writing, commuting, traveling, cooking, eating,
working out, cleaning, hanging with friends and many other activities can
involve music.  Notice what music resonates with you and allow your
attention to go there.  An artist who captures your attention has succeeded
in connecting with you through their expression.  That expression then
relates to you. </p>

<p>A song that has captured your attention becomes part of your life
soundtrack whether you like the song or not.  If you don't like it, skip and
don't dwell.  Generalized dislike restricts you. Over time you might change,
what the song means to you might change, artists might change.  Tracking
negative is not worth your time.  If you like the song, click the heart
button or take note of the title and artist. </p>

<p>The other part of attending is just that.  Attend.  As in attend a music
performance.  Go in person if you can, virtually if you are separated by
time, distance or access.  Go at your own pace.  Also attend to whatever
other music sources you might find fun or interesting, whether that's radio,
art installations, foreign airline seat programming, news feeds, record
stores or anywhere else you find music.  Check out things that seem
interesting even if they aren't part of your playlist or usual range.  How
you connect is wider than you will know at any given time. </p>

<h2>Keep</h2>

<p>When you click a heart button, or note the title and artist, you are
starting a relationship with a song.  When you hear the song again, you
begin to decide if you want to keep it with you.  If you are streaming, and
you notice the song playing, then you notice the heart button is already
set, you might choose to keep it.  If you are looking up a title and artist
you previously noted, then your current listening experience together with
the memory of your previous listening experience might lead you to keep
it. </p>

<p>If you are streaming, the easiest way to keep a song is to add it to a
playlist.  I recommend keeping an annual playlist of keeper songs.  Download
the list at the end of the year so you have a copy in case anything ever
happens with your service. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you may decide to keep a copy of the actual song, either
as a single or on an album.  It's usually worth getting the album if you can
find more than one song on there you might like.  You might want a digital
file, physical media, or both.  Physical media like vinyl can feel like a
more tangible connection to the artist and your music community.  It might
also include additional artwork, lyrics, notes or other material that can
reinforce your connection or enhance your listening experience as you hold
or display it. </p>

<p>There is no single best way to keep your music.  Whether you are keeping
copies of yearly playlists, digital media, physical media, or some
combination, the important thing is to keep your music as you would anything
of value you have. </p>


<h2>Repeat</h2>

<p>Then listen to what you've kept.  Then attend.  Then keep.  Then listen
again.  How you keep your music will change over your life.  Probably
multiple times.  How you personally hold the music part of you is your
choice. </p>
