<h1>Why Own Digital Music?</h1>

<p>Streaming is ultimate radio with a robot DJ spinning anything you want
anytime you want to hear it.  That never stops being amazing.  When legal
streaming first became available, it quickly transformed into a foundation
of our digital music lives.  Finally we could listen without first having to
buy the album, hope the song plays on the radio, find a
listen-before-you-buy store, or borrow.  Streaming changed the world.  Some
people ditched their personal music collections, convinced they never needed
to own any music anymore. </p>

<h2>What you lost</h2>

<p>Beyond monthly fees and increased advertising, you also gave up musical
anchor points connecting past, present and future you.  There is no physical
artifact, or even a digital file, connecting you to a musical work.  You
can't collect music in a streaming service, you can only bookmark it in
various ways within the service.  That's not the same. </p>

<p>If I buy an album for a throw-a-few-bucks-in-the-tipjar cost of $3, that
probably comes out around 25 cents a song, which is arguably somewhere in
the range of what I might contribute in streaming revenue over many years.
Financially, those two kinds of transactions might be considered equivalent,
but otherwise they are fundamentally different.  When I buy music, I've made
it clear I appreciate that particular musical work.  I didn't just click a
button while streaming along, I committed to it.  My life is now connected
to that musical work, I own it, and my experience of it evolves over my
lifetime whenever I play it. </p>

<p>A streaming service does not foundationally care about your relationship
to an artist's work, they care you are happy enough with the service to
continue paying the monthly fee or listening to ads.  They cannot support
music ownership because that's not what they do.  If a service allowed you
to upload music you already own, then download exactly that same music
whenever you wanted, then it would support ownership, and it would be called
a backup service.  What a streaming service does is provide access to the
library copy of whatever songs they choose to provide.  Owning a music file
yourself elevates the musical work out of the streamosphere and into your
personal sphere.  Your music becomes yours. </p>

<p>If you are an enthusiastic listener, paying standard retail price for all
the albums you want will likely be prohibitively expensive.  Meanwhile you will
still need streaming to play music you don't own, and you definitely are not
going to buy everything you listen to.  You might not be able to afford
buying much.  So what should you own? </p>

<h2>Your life experience stash</h2>

<p>Your personal music stash holds music from your life experiences.  That
might include festivals, performances, bars, clubs, busking, art
installations, travel destinations, and anything else worth a sonic
postcard.  These recordings will be worth keeping around for the memories
alone.  Some may end up meaning more than you would have imagined at the
time. </p>

<p>Obviously the site of your epic vacation hike will not be offering CDs for
sale at the trailhead, so this is going to take some research.  That's part
of what makes it rewarding.  Keep an ear out while you're in the general
area, talk to people about what they listen to, and find local artists.
Especially things that sound different from what you usually hear. </p>

<p>Regional targeting is very much a thing, so try do your searching while
you are in that corner of the world.  Your streaming service may also try
keep you inside the boundaries of what it thinks you like, so consider
general search.  What you are looking for in this case is more about the
place than about you. </p>

<p>Once you've found something you feel might be appropriate, get it, even
if you are not sure whether you will listen to it much.  Prefer to buy from
a local artist or local organization.  After you buy, download to make sure
you don't bump into any regional complication when you get back.  Copy files
to your other devices after you get home. </p>

<p>Building a life experience stash is seriously fun.  And it's never too
late to revisit a previous life experience and bring that sound back into
your life. </p>

<h2>Your permanent collection</h2>

<p>As you stash life experience music, you might find yourself thinking what
other music could be important enough to keep with you the rest of your
life.  That's a highly personal decision depending on what the music means
to you. </p>

<p>If you buy a physical record album, it becomes part of your home,
visually reaffirming some aspect of your identity to you and anyone else you
feel close enough to have visit you.  When you buy a digital album, it's
just for you.  The meaning and attachment is the same, but it doesn't matter
much what anyone else might think because it's not presented.  So the focus
is entirely on what you personally have connected with and would like to
stay connected to. </p>

<p>My music is probably not be the same as your music, and what my music
means to me might not be the same as what your music means to you, but in
case it is helpful for getting started, here's how I approach selecting what
music I am going to keep: </p>

<ol>

<li><em>Note</em>.  If a song captures my attention enough for me to notice
it as a potentially outstanding musical work, I save a link with a few words
describing what it was, then add it to a queue to play again sometime later.
For me "later" is usually at least a week, frequently longer.  Sometimes I
note a song the first time I hear it, sometimes after hearing it a few times.

<li><em>Revisit</em>.  The second time I play a remarkable song, I add to my
previous note to describe what I'm noticing more on second listen.  If I
still think the song is outstanding and worthy of further consideration, I
put it back in the queue to play again later.  Many songs don't get
re-queued at this point.  Sometimes they're not as outstanding as I
previously thought, sometimes they just aren't going to connect with me
personally.  For whatever reason, sometimes streaming is probably enough
lifetime connection.

<li><em>Decide</em>.  By the third time I'm playing an outstanding song, I'm
looking at my previous notes and considering if the song could qualify as a
lasting part of me.  If it does, I'll try buy the song or the album.  If
it's too expensive and there's no used option, sometimes I'll change my
mind.  If it's free or inexpensive and there's an option to pay more, I'll
add to match what I want to give the artist.

</ol>

<p>Generally, buying the album is preferable.  The album provides access to
the larger musical work, and allows for appreciating the song in context.
Frequently I listen to the album as part of deciding to own the song.  If I
can play the album all the way through, I get it.  If I skip some songs but
find at least one other track that's also potentially outstanding, then I
get it.  If there's no other interesting tracks, or the album content
detracts from the song, then I'll either buy the single or change my mind on
owning. </p>


<h2>Permanent you</h2>

<p>I hope you will consider keeping some of your core music with you as you
listen through life.  Future you will appreciate it. </p>

<p>This article is part of an ongoing exploration of listener connection
to digital music, and what that means in an ever expanding music world. </p>
