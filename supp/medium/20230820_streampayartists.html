<h1>Supporting musicians through streaming</h1>

<p>A brief writeup on how musicians get paid from streaming, with some
possible improvements to help them earn a living. </p>


<h2>How streaming services pay artists</h2>

<p>When I first heard Apple Music was paying one cent per stream, and Spotify was paying a third of that, I had questions.  If I listen 8hrs/day, with an average song length of 3:17, that's 146 songs/day, or 4454 songs/month.  So that would be $44.54 being paid out by Apple (which costs $9.99) or $14.87 being paid by Spotify (which costs $10.99).  How can they do that? </p>

<p>Simple.  They don't. </p>

<p>Streaming services pay out a percentage of their revenue.  Apple pays
52%, so apparently around $5.49 of each monthly Apple Music subscription
should be distributed to artists and copyright holders.  That's less than
the default cost of an album on Bandcamp, but it's something. </p>

<p>The most prevalent distribution approach right now is to take the
percentage of revenue the service is willing to pay, then divide that total
amount across all the streamed song plays.  This straightforward "pro-rata"
approach means everybody's subscription fees support all artists being
streamed.  Services like Spotify and Apple Music use pro-rata distribution.
Other services such as Tidal and Deezer would prefer a more user-centric
approach.  More on that in a bit. </p>

<p>It's possible for streaming services to explore more closely tied
payments these days because sound recordings each have a unique ID, and
there are centralized clearinghouses for payments to artists and copyright
holders.  That's the short story.  Here's a simplified (yes I do actually
mean simplified) view of the U.S. content and money flow as I currently
understand it: </p>

<h2>Connecting listeners more directly to artists</h2>

<p>With identifying information for each song, and payment paths for
everyone associated with each song, it should be possible to more directly
connect listeners to the artists they like.  For example a listener might
expect the revenue portion of their streaming subscription be paid to the
artists they actually listen to, rather than across all artists streaming on
the platform.  This "user-centric" or "fan centered" approach would more
directly connect real music enthusiasts to the musicians they listen to, and
it could improve income prospects for niche artists with strong but smaller
total audience share. </p>

<p>With a user-centric revenue model, streaming platform payments more
accurately reflect audience appreciation.  The streaming platform behaves
more like a market, driven by an audience value reward model similar to what
Medium is doing for articles. </p>

<p>User-centric payment models are still in development.  They are
disruptive to the status quo.  The accounting needs to be clear, and the
implementation needs to be reliable.  It's an exciting time, and an
opportunity to connect to artists you like.  But will it allow niche artists
to make a living wage from streaming? </p>

<!-- each listener pays 10 / 3000 = 0.0033 per song each month
     so each Niche Artist X fan pays 0.0066 each month.
     30000 / 0.66 = 4,545,455 fans.
30000 / ((10 / 3000) * 2) -->

<p>To get an idea of the magnitudes involved, consider a Magical Streaming
Service (MSS) that pays an obviously unsustainable 100% of every listener's
$10/month fee directly to the artists whose songs they listen to.
Enthusiastic MSS subscribers listen to 3000 songs/month, and that includes
two songs from Niche Artist X.  To make $30k/year, X would need well over 4
million MSS fans. </p>

<p>For comparison, X can make $30k selling 6000 albums at $5 each.  Or X could play 50 shows a year at $600 per performance. </p>

<p>What else might be possible to increase artist income in a predominantly
streaming world? </p>

<h2>Tips appreciated</h2>

<p>When we see someone performing live, and we like what we hear, many of us
will throw some money into whatever container is available for that purpose.
It's not much, but it can add up.  An extra tip, multiplied by the listener
exposure of streaming, could be very significant.  It could also directly
connect listeners and artists.  Not the same as seeing a live performance,
but more than just streaming. </p>

<p>Picture a supplemental service where you pre-load your tip wallet with
$10 or so.  Whenever an artist really nails it, you throw some money their
way.  It's hard to imagine a more affirmative response to a song. </p>

<p>Now imagine what a difference that could make for a niche artist used to getting a fraction of a cent per play.  They would definitely appreciate it. </p>

<h2>Edge music awards</h2>

<p>Streaming platforms have an opportunity to directly encourage musical
creativity through monthly music awards.  In terms of magnitude, a service
might choose to allocate something around the cost of what they pay a few
employees.  The service would then make monthly awards to notable artists
whose streaming income would otherwise be less than $1000. </p>

<p>Awards enhance the streaming service's brand, benefit the artists, and
enrich the music community as a whole.  A streaming service that follows
their listener's interests can identify interesting growth edges of the
current zeitgeist whether towards new music or previously released material.
A service can help its larger listener base gain from the experience of
those listening at the edges. </p>

<p>Receiving an award would make a substantial difference to an artist who
otherwise wasn't making much that month.  Simultaneously, presenting awards
catapults the service into a visibly active part of the music
community. </p>

<h2>Connect artists with fans</h2>

<p>Artists need fans, and they know how fans can best connect with them.
Streaming services can help make the connection by allowing artists to
display how to get in touch within the streaming app interface. </p>

<p>It may not seem like much to offer direct connection links, but it saves
searching, which helps avoid missed connections.  By providing a path for
direct connection, a streaming platform increases its impact on the wider
music community.  Fans are the lifeblood of performing artists, and both
parties would appreciate an introduction. </p>

<p>Even when an artist is no longer living, fans might still connect
directly to find out more about the artist or check out merchandise.  They
might choose to be notified when remastered recordings are released, or be
informed of related media like a book or movie.  The current owner may or
may not choose to provide contact, but most should appreciate the option to
help carry the artist's impact forward. </p>

<p>Any streaming service that directly connects fans to artists grows beyond
a commodity entertainment mechanism into an active music community hub. </p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Making a living from streaming alone is difficult.  There are
opportunities to do better, and the technology is within reach.  Thoughts
welcome. </p>
