<h1>Codifying my music and discovering a world of listening</h1>

<p>If you have a digital music collection, you may have experienced an odd
growing pain.  This became noticeable for me as my music collection grew
into hundreds of artists.  My library perversely became less approachable
for general listening.  I could easily find and play great selections for
every conceivable situation, except for the one where just about anything
would be fine, but I didn't want to spend time browsing. </p>

<p>It seemed an easy fix to just pick something at random, and since I know
how to make a computer do things, I started in on that. </p>

<h2>It's not random.</h2>

<p>Nobody wants random.  Random can pick the same thing twice in a row while
leaving huge swaths of a collection gathering dust effectively forever.
What is meant by "random" is "shuffle": randomly mix everything up and then
follow the shuffled order.  Still simple, but playback needs to keep
following the shuffled order and skip anything played in the meantime.  If I
reshuffle, it's preferable if recently played music gets placed further
back in the queue. </p>

<p>Apropos "recently played", how often something gets played matters.  Some
songs have been overplayed and should come up less frequently.  That could
be tracked by monitoring when I hit the skip button.  If I flag a song as
tired, the playback frequency should be reduced if I skip it. </p>

<p>There are also some songs that are only appropriate in the context of the
album. The first song on an album is fine because I can just play the rest
of the album at that point. Most other album songs are also fine to play
separately, but I should be able to flag any middle songs that don't make
sense to play on their own. </p>

<p>Shuffle needs to react to me. </p>

<h2>There's feedback.</h2>

<p>If my selector is reacting to what I've played, whether something is
played too often, and if it's ok to play a song outside of its album
context, what other feedback should it pay attention to?</p>

<p>Ratings are helpful for marking those songs that are especially great, or
noticeably not.  It's rare for me to only listen to my favorites, and even
my less-awesome tracks are worth hearing occasionally, but it's useful to
filter when I'm showcasing music for other people. </p>

<p>Apropos other people, I'd like to be able to flag songs as social if I
feel they are good for groups.  Some great music is fantastic intimate
listening, but not great at larger gatherings.  I'd also like be able to
flag personal songs that should only be played for me.  With some music,
what the song means for me has changed and I don't want it automatically
coming up unless it's just me listening. </p>

<p>Depending on my mood, who I'm listening with, and what I'm doing, how
approachable a song is can matter.  It would be helpful to indicate how
challenging or easy it is so I can then filter an acceptable range for my
current listening context.  Energy level would also be helpful.  How chill
or amped a song is doesn't always match tempo, and being able to filter on
that would help avoid drops or jarring surprises in some situations. </p>

<p>Genres can be helpful for search, even if I'm usually willing to span
everything I collect.  Sometimes wider genres like "jazz" or "classical" are
things I want to temporarily focus on or avoid.  There are also some
personal pseudo-genres like "office" or "holiday" I find helpful because I'm
particular about what gets played in those situations.  Other people might
have their own particularities.  Open keywords let a selector filter
appropriately on unique characteristics inherent in any personal
collection. </p>

<p>My impressions need to be part of my library.</p>

<h2>My music.</h2>

<p>After several iterations figuring that out, my selector was working, and
I went back through my entire music collection adding what I thought to the
music I have chosen to keep.  My past, present and future self had a
listening party that went on for like a year.  During that time I
experienced more enjoyment and growth as a listener than I can remember in a
long time. </p>

<p>And it worked.  Two days in, I was able to autoselect approachable social
music at a medium energy level for listening with others.  They liked the
"playlist".  After a few weeks, I could get office music playing faster than
I could put in earbuds.  Now I'm ecstatic my entire music collection will
retrieve and play automatically at the start of an app.  Adding new music
now expands both my collection and my listening self. </p>

<p>Of course I still pull specific things from my library whenever something
specific occurs to me.  The added annotations have been useful for search,
and I don't have to worry about songs getting overplayed or ignored.  My
library is still the wondrous auditory buffet it's always been.  Meanwhile I
use automatic retrieval daily. </p>

<p>In retrospect, it should not be surprising that personal music access can
be automated using a few variable values and curated keywords.  Each of us
already knows our music, we just need a format to save our impressions with
the songs.  After all, the difference between a personal music library and a
folder full of digital files is how you feel about it and how easily you can
hear what you want. </p>


<h2>Our music.</h2>

<p>So what could happen if several of us had codified libraries? Each of us
would enjoy personalized music access, and we might also choose to
collaborate through our library knowledge.  To start, you might decide if
you respect my musical opinions based on the music we both value highly. I
could discover great music from you, whether it's a new release or something
I previously missed. You might discover great music from me that matches
your current listening context. Any number of us could interact with each
other whenever we wanted through the impressions codified in our music
libraries. </p>

<p>That could get really interesting. If you have a digital music library
and want to try this out, get in touch. </p>
