<p>If you listen to music 16 hours a day, you'll hear 107,815 average length
songs in one year.  If you keep up that pace for 90 years, you might succeed
in hearing almost 10% of the music currently streaming.  If you want to
check out new releases, access other recordings, or listen to anything more
than once along the way, in all likelihood you will hear less than 5% of all
available music. </p>

<p>For a quality 5% listening lifetime, you're going to need quality
guidance.</p>

<p>Quality guidance, like quality music, comes from individuals and groups
who put their expertise, personality, knowledge, time, effort and soul into
it.  People who curate their music and can recommend things to you based on
their knowledge and your interests.  Think record store owner, but also
catalogers, critics, music programmers, live music organizers, musicians,
producers, DJs, record labels, and anyone with a music collection they
actually listen to.</p>

<p>People who are able to suggest great music are, like you and me, just as
inundated with advertising and low quality music as anyone else.  They can
post a suggestion after hearing something outstanding, but just posting a
link isn't particularly compelling.  You might be the world's most popular
music expert and I'm still wondering why I should listen.  If you are a
friend, I might check it out because I'm curious what you are into these
days, but I would have appreciated if you said something about why this is
worth my listening time.</p>

<p>How can we better communicate music suggestions?</p>

<h2>"I bought this".</h2>

<p>Paying for a piece of music is an unassailable endorsement.  You have
committed to it.  By sharing that fact, you are willing to put this music
forward as a part of who you are, regardless of how people might think that
affects your reputation.  Unless I strongly suspect you are an
undifferentiating hoarder, I'm going to respect your endorsement.</p>

<h2>Describe it.</h2>

<p>Any description is better than no description.  Keep it tight.  What is
it about this particular music that makes it a good suggestion?  Any
combination of categorical adjectives will match thousands of recordings,
what makes this one special?  If you can decribe something about what you
hear, I'm more likely to share your experience.</p>

<p>Unless it's obvious from the conversation, help prepare me to listen by
mentioning:</p><ul>

<li><em>Energy Level</em>: From unplugged to amps on 11, from drone to full
    panic BPM, let me know so I can ready my expected adrenaline response.

<li><em>Approachability</em>: From soothing to challenging, bubblegum to
    edge experimental, let me know so I can adjust my expected listening
    context.

<li><em>Noteworthy aspects</em>: If there is something in this music I
    should be sure to notice, let me know so I can be sure to notice it.

</ul>

<p>Providing occasional listening suggestions is part of being a good music
friend. I'm going to do what I can in my listening lifetime. If you are
able, do what you can to help your friends experience the good stuff. We get
