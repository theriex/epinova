My older music is an anchor to my younger self and what the music meant to
me then.  Memories of what the world was like then and what I was like then
are very relevant personally, but not musically (with allowances for lyric
acceptability, social references and technology innovation).

The context of music at the time of its release is important in terms of its
societal and personal historical impact.  Music can exist as simply a
snapshot of another time, but for it to remain alive, you need to listen to
it again.  You need to hear and connect who you were to who you are, where
you are going and why.
