Getting to know an album requires listening to it a few times, but reserving
time for that is hard.  One helpful suggestion is to copy a few albums
worthy of leisure study onto your phone, thereby transforming periods of
limited connectivity into leisure study time you can actually look forward
to.

My phone?  Really?

Obviously playing a vinyl album on a turntable is better.  Cherish your
album rig and your listening when you can.  I already wrote about <how
playing a record on a turntable can enhance your digital listening>, this is
just pointing out that your phone is usually there with you when life
provides opportunity for leisure study, so may as well take a minute to set
yourself up.

Whether you use a streaming service or purchase music that is important to
you, setting up offline listening your first time might feel a bit fiddly
but it's not hard.  You might need to search for whatever particular
variation of Apple Music sync, Android File Transfer or offline streaming is
appropriate for your situation.  Once you've set up the first time, updates
are straightforward.


A brief note on storage.

This might seem too stupid to mention, but when you download music from a
streaming service for listening offline, it occupies approximately the same
space as downloading music files directly.  The only difference is that with
the streaming app, the data is in the streaming app storage, and with music
files it's in the phone music storage.  You can mix and match, so if you
want to download purchased albums for offline listening and use streaming
for online listening it's about the same space.

In terms of sound quality, a streaming service will typically put some
effort into giving you the best sound quality for the smallest storage.
Your phone music storage supports whatever iOS or Android supports.  In both
cases you may have choices about which music file format you prefer, and
your preference will impact how much storage you use.  Like video, higher
resolutions require more space.

The size of a video, music, or picture file is approximate because compression...

The desire to really listen to an album is there.  Realizing..

When you take the time to really listen to an album, you are taking the time 
Leisure study is not an oxymoron.  When you decide to really listen to an
album, that's what you do.
