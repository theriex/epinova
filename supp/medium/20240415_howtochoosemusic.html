<h1>How to choose music?</h1>

<p>Uniqueness, depth of expression, and how much you connect.  Simple, but
not automatically easy, and after seeing several of my fellow listeners
getting a bit lost and overwhelmed, this seems worth writing down in the
interest of increased enjoyment. </p>

<h2>Terms</h2>

<p><em>Uniqueness</em> is like the opposite of sameness.  Sameness is
boring.  Too much sameness might make you boring.  Uniqueness deserves your
attention. </p>

<p><em>Depth of expression</em> reflects the time, energy, and capability of
the artist.  Simple music can have depth, and complicated music can be
shallow.  At a base level this is about how much heart and soul you can hear
went into the creation of what you are listening to. </p>

<p><em>How much you connect with it</em>.  Note that phrasing.  All songs
try to connect with you, so it's your choice if you want to let that happen.
Choosing music is more about you going to it than it coming to you.  If you
find a song interesting, compelling, outstanding, or any other superlative,
consider revisiting it.  If you're revisiting a song, consider collecting
it. </p>

<p>Here's how this works in a few music discovery situations. </p>

<h2>Matchmaking</h2>

<p>When you have excellent music in common with another person, unknown major
milestones from their musical journey are probably worth listening to.  They
found unique qualities and depth, now you might connect also. </p>

<p>As you listen, you will quickly hear if it something sounds like a lot of
other things you have.  If it's not a <em>lot</em> of other things,
perhaps you will differentiate more later.  If the song is surprisingly
different, give yourself a chance to discover what unique aspects might pull
for you.</p>

<p>If you respect your guide's listening capabilities, then the song
probably has adequate depth of expression.  If you're not hearing much, take
a moment to try and discern what they might have found, or ask them what
they think is particularly great about it.  Most people are happy to
describe their favorite music, and it can be fun to learn, even if what you
learn ends up more about them than the music. </p>

<p>Sometimes you will connect to a song quickly.  If not, listen through
anyway and decide at the end if it might be worth a second listen later.  If
not, at least you've explored more of your musical universe. </p>

<p>Matchmakers can be friends, expert reviewers, professional DJs or other
curators whose tastes you trust. </p>

<h2>Touring</h2>

<p>Listening is musical tourism.  Anytime you are online, you have thousands
of potential tours to choose from, paid or ad-supported.  Some tours can be
amazing.  Most tours are pretty good, but they tend towards sameness.  If
you're feeling adventurous, you might have to nudge the operator a bit to
avoid getting pigeonholed.  One way is to start from a suggested song, or
maybe an artist or producer.  Genres and labels can be useful but sometimes
limiting.  How best to nudge the operator depends on the tour, and you may
have to experiment a bit. </p>

<p>Finding uniqueness while touring might be rare, but it's rewarding. </p>

<p>Depth of expression is not a primary consideration for most tours.  Most
artists put quite a bit of time and effort into creating what you are
hearing, but how you listen and how they convey might not match well.  One
advantage of being on a tour is that listening expectations don't vary too
much from one song to the next, so trust what you feel when you notice
depth. </p>

<p>If you don't discern any uniqueness or depth, and you don't feel an
immediate connection, hit the skip button.  If you hear anything notable,
listen through and decide if it's worth revisiting.  </p>

<h2>News</h2>

<p>Older releases are the structure, context and history of the music world.
New releases are the lifeblood.  You need both.  For the lifeblood part,
following a feed of new releases tailored to your current interests makes you
an active part of the music scene.  Artists want you involved, and what you
think matters. <p>

<p>Because there is more music available than anyone can possibly listen to
in one lifetime, uniqueness is relative only to your own experience.  If you
feel it's unique, it's unique. </p>

<p>With new releases, feeling depth of expression can be particularly moving
since you and the artist are still close in time.  If they put their heart
and soul into a song and you feel it, they've succeeded.  You might even be
able to let them know. </p>

<p>The strange thing about connecting to new releases is that it's not
strange.  It works exactly the same as any other listening situation except
there's no peer pressure.  That can be liberating. </p>


<h2>Life</h2>

<p>Random social posts, broadcast radio, movies, documentaries, live shows,
opening music, parties and everything else all work the same way.
Uniqueness, depth of expression, and how much you connect with it.  Enjoy
your music world. </p>
