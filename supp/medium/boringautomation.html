<h1>Why automated music gets boring, and how to fix it.</h1>

<p>I love discovering new music through streaming, but it tends to get stuck in a rut.  That's improved over the years, but too often there's still a creeping low level dissatisfaction in the music appreciation part of my brain.  If most of what I heard was at least generally good, why is this happening?  As a software developer and musician, I've spent quite some time looking into this over the past years.  Here are some suggestions on how your listening experience could be improved, and what you can do. </p>


<h2>Change it up a bit please.</h2>

<p>If you are dancing to a song, and want to keep on dancing, then you would prefer the next song have a compatible tempo and feel to keep the groove going.  Likewise if you are listening to meditational ambient, it probably also makes sense for the next song to continue that vibe.  However for general listening, following with similar songs gets boring. </p>

<p>A lot of time and effort has been expended figuring out how songs can be marked up for compatibility and playback sequencing.  Perhaps more effort could be put into figuring out how much similarity should be applied and when, but unless your music player reacts to your mood or monitors your musical boredom level, automated guessing won't be enough.  So what can be done?  Perhaps something as simple as a "Hey DJ!" button with an option to "Change it up a bit" could do the trick.</p>

<p>In the meantime while we're all waiting patiently for anything like that, what can you do?  Change the station.  Switch to a different playlist.  Choose a song that is different from what is playing.  If you can choose a different song, that's probably the most effective.  The important thing is to take some kind of action the moment you notice things getting monotonous. </p>

<h2>Consider what I think.</h2>

<p>Streaming music services have an incredible opportunity to enable connection and interaction with your listening peers.  If you think a collection of songs is good, and others also think those songs are good, plus they have more songs that you haven't heard, then you should probably listen to those also. </p>

<p>Probably. </p>

<p>Let's pretend for a minute that those other listeners are not promo bots but actual people.  Let's further pretend their musical appreciation is at least somewhat trustworthy and discriminating.  If this is the case, their guidance could lead to some really great music.  Otherwise it could lead to the personal equivalent of supermarket music. </p>

<p>What to do?  Obviously track if I listen to the new song or skip it.  Weight that backwards towards the sources to determine if they are, in fact, reliable guides.  Maybe step it up a notch and let me flag a song as interesting.  Even if I don't like the song or it's not what I want to hear right now, it still might have been a good suggestion.  In this case, instead of a "Hey DJ!" button, the auto DJ might provide a way for me to respond more explicitly to the newly suggested track it just threw down. </p>

<p>In the meantime, as a listener, try not to do anything that will cause the automation to cut you off from future suggestions that might be great.  Give new songs a chance, and try to only skip or dislike if it's actually bad. If it's good, note that, but don't flag mediocre stuff as good, that doesn't help anybody. </p>

<p>While on the subject of trying to manage algorithms, it would be wonderful if it were possible to cleanly block an artist without cascading effects on suggested music from other artists.  Sometimes it's just personal. </p>

<h2>Help me explore.</h2>

<p>Streaming whatever you want is the magic you pay for monthly, but locating what you want to hear can sometimes be challenging, especially if you are unsure of the details or it's a less popular song.  Exploring the greater musicverse as a whole is overwhelming.  With all the music data currently available, this is desperately in need of better navigation support. </p>

<p>A song is typically on one or more albums.  It is created by one or more artists, possibly in collaboration with others.  Somebody produced it, mastered it, maybe remixed it.  It was released on a label that might have other related artists.  Artists influence other artists over time.  They cover music written by other artists and reference other artists in what they write.  The musicverse is a massively rich multi-dimensional relationship space that would be exciting to explore.  Make it available.  Show my paths through it.  Exploring the world of music interactively with the full power of modern data processing would be wonderful. </p>

<p>While we're all waiting patiently for anything like that, definitely continue to check out the album when a song grabs you.  Look up the artist and read about them.  See what has been critically acclaimed.  Find those hidden works that will stay with you for life. </p>


<h2>Support local music.</h2>

<p>Exploring the world of local music is important enough it seems worth a separate mention.  With everything available, let me filter based on a city or region so I can get to know working musicians in the area.  Whether "local" is where I live now, or where I'm traveling to, it would be helpful to know who is around.  Maybe I'll go to a show or something.  Most artists don't make enough just from streaming. </p>

<h2>Don't overplay.</h2>

<p>Playlists and autoplay can effortlessly lead to a great song being played too often.  It's still a great song, it's just getting too much airtime.  There needs to be a way for a song to be queued up less frequently without impacting general music recommendations.  For example if I feel a song should be played at most once a week, and it comes up again in a playlist during the week, it should automatically be skipped.  It should only be played again during that week if I request it explicitly. </p>

<p>Different people have different listening scopes.  Some might be happy with a tight working set of 50 songs in active rotation.  A general listener would probably want a working set more like 500 songs.  Avid listeners with strong musical memory might feel constrained with a working set smaller than 5000 songs.  All listeners would appreciate being able to flag a song as overplayed, with options to limit the rotational frequency to weekly or monthly or quarterly or yearly.  There should also be an option to never automatically play a song again.  In all these cases, feelings about the song haven't substantively changed. </p>

<p>If your streaming platform does not have playback frequency tuning, pay attention to what options you have.  Repeatedly skipping a song or liking it less might shift what is suggested for you in the future.  Removing a song from your playlists will probably help, but could also affect future suggestions.  Consider having a "holding tank" playlist for overplayed great songs you move out of your general rotation playlists. </p>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Increasing playback diversity, tracking impressions, not overplaying, and helping to explore the larger music world would make streaming a more enjoyable experience.  With the music modernization act licensing availability in effect since in January 2021, we can all hopefully look forward to more streaming options with improved features.  After battling limited algorithms and limited data options for decades, I'm definitely ready for the next level. Let's kick this up a notch. </p>
